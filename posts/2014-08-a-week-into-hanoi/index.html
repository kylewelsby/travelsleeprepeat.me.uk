We kept the itinerary simple over the days, checking out nearby museums, local eateries and familiarizing ourselves with the area.

<p>Having tackled the chaos of Indiaâ€™s traffic and constant hassle of questions/tuk tuks/beggars, we both felt a huge wave of calm over us in Hanoi (<em>even though there still is traffic and horns, itâ€™s tame compared to India!</em>).</p>
<p>We kept the itinerary simple over the days, checking out nearby museums, local eateries and familiarizing ourselves with the area.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the vibe around the Old Quarter as it has something for everyone . Thereâ€™s plenty of restaurants and bars all within walking distance, as well as the â€˜beer cornerâ€™ which is naturally a huge tourist magnet due to its cheap prices (approx. 5000 VND per half pint, which is equivalent in UK standards to about 14p!!!)</p>
<p><img src=images/IMG_4268.jpg alt></p>
<p>Now Iâ€™m not a fan of beer, but for 14p even I canâ€™t resist buying half a pint!</p>
<p>There are several museums to check out (eg. Womens Museum, Museum of Ethonology or Temple of Literature to name a few) for a good dosage of culture, whilst a visit to the Hoam Kiem lake is a calm setting to chill out, have an ice cream and people watch.</p>

<p>We successfully managed to send our India souvenir box back home (yay!) with a standard courier service. We went for the cheapest option which was via cargo â€“ the downside is that itâ€™ll take 3 months to reach home but weâ€™re glad for now that itâ€™s out of our hands (fingers crossed for a safe delivery!)</p>
<p><img src=images/IMG_20140809_114848.jpg alt></p>
<p>Bye bye box! Safe journey back to the UK!</p>
<p>The staff at Tulinh Palace 2 have been superb so far, weâ€™ve always been greeted with smiles and warm welcomes no matter what time of the day. Weâ€™ve booked 2 excursions through the hotel â€“ a 2 night trek & home stay at Sapa and a 2 night cruise at Halong Bay. Looks we got a busy week ahead of us ðŸ™‚</p>
