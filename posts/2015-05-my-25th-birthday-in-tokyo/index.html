<p>Being in a mega city which has so much to do I decided not to stress out and plan a fancy evening out somewhere, but rather go out and do the things I enjoyed doing here.</p>
<p>So I played retro arcade games, out of curiosity went to a maid cafe and then went to a live music bar in the evening. I got free play at the arcade, free birthday cake at the maid cafe and free shots at the bar. It was that cheap, simple and stress free, feeling old in Tokyo never felt so good!</p>
