<p>A couple days after settling into our new surroundings and hotel we booked ourselves on a street food tour. I found the tour via TripAdvisor and after a couple of quick friendly emails we were booked for the next day. We opted for the 17:00 start departing at the tour office. The price per person is 20$.</p>
<p>Our guide for the evening was Sea, a fun quirky guy who kept us entertained throughout our time. In total there were 8 of us which was a great size to interact with. We tried a variety of Vietnamese dishes, consisting of pho, spring rolls, stuffed pancakes, mangosteens, fruit salad, lemon tea, local beer and egg coffee (yum!)</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>As we had experienced a food tour in India, we were wiser this time round and ate little bits at each establishment to avoid getting full too early!</p>
<p>I was personally satisfied with each dish I tried, but my favourite had to be the egg coffee. We all thought the worst (<em>would it be like scrambled egg floating in black coffee?!</em>) but I’m glad I was proved wrong! The egg is frothed up to a creamy (almost liquid meringue-like) texture, combined with the coffee just makes it so delicious! It’s definitely one to drink slow to savour the experience.</p>
<p>The tour ended with the lovely Sea asking us what we all enjoyed and giving us all a big hug as we returned back to the office. After the tour ended a few of us decided to go for a drink in a nearby bar. It was great to meet new people and share travelling experiences over a couple’ drinks.</p>

<p>The delight that is egg coffee!</p>
<p>Overall I’d thoroughly recommend Hanoi Street Food tours. There will be places which we’ll definitely return to again, especially the egg coffee! I think this is a must do in Hanoi, don’t miss the opportunity to sample local cuisine and gain new friends!</p>

<p>Some locals were celebrating their birthday at a bar we went into for a couple’ drinks after the tour. They had a huge cake and kindly brought around a couple of slices to us and others at the bar. As a thank you we all pitched in and bought them a birthday drink! p.s. the cake was GOOD!</p>
