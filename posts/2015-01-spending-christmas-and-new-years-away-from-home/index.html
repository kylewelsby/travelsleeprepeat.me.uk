<p>This is the first time we’ve spent both Christmas and New Years in another country. Our passports allow us to stay in Malaysia for 3 months without a visa so we have both time and flexibility here. The first few weeks in Kuala Lumpur will be spent resting up – we then intend to stay for around a month after so Kyle can catch up with work commitments.</p>
<p>Though Malaysia gets involved in the festive spirit Christmas is treated like any other day. To be honest we loved the fact the Christmas wasn’t such a big deal. Every year back in the UK the TV is taken over by Christmassy adverts/films/songs, whilst the shopping centres are choked up with customers grabbing anything Christmas related for the ‘big day’.</p>
<p>We were getting to the point in our travels where we started to miss home and family – especially at this time of year where we reminisced on previous Christmas feasts we used to indulge in (<em>yes</em> <em>I don’t like Christmas but I do like loads of chocolate, mince pies and mulled wine!</em>).</p>
<p>We’ve been traveling for nearly 6 months and wanted to stay somewhere with a little bit of luxury (e.g. with a pool and gym). We booked a really nice AirBnB apartment which had the all the amenities to relax and catch up on some decent sleep (in a proper bed!). Not wanting to feel left out on Christmas we went to a gourmet supermarket and stock up on some ingredients to cook ourselves a mini feast.</p>

<p>Our home-cooked Christmas meal, it was so good!</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur reminds of us our own homely comforts – shopping malls, restaurants and pavements designated for walking! We miss cooking so it was a wlecomed prospect to buy our own ingredients and cook to our hearts content.<img src=images/nandos.jpg alt="Enjoying a Nandos after 6 months! "></p>
<p>Enjoying a Nandos after 6 months!</p>
<p>We’ve previously celebrated New Years in big cities like London and Edinburgh and wanted to do something a little different this year.</p>
<p>Originally the plan was to have a flat gathering with the other guests and their friends. Unfortunately the plan fell apart when a family had rented out one of the rooms with a child! Undeterred by the setback me and Kyle went to the top floor of the residency with a few drinks and watched the fireworks from the top deck.</p>
<p>It was a simple stress free way to start the New Year!</p>

<p>New Years fireworks which lasted for about 5 minutes!</p>
<p>I really enjoyed being away from the Christmas festivities and experiencing a New Year in another country. It was refreshing to see another perspective from a culture which don’t conform to the festivities we see back in the UK.</p>
<p>Staying in an apartment and having the ability to cook our own food and sleep in a real bed did help us with our homesickness. Of course we miss our families and comforts, but we still have the desire to travel and see more of Asia – nearly 6 months and we still feel like we haven’t scratched the surface yet!</p>
