<p class=py-6>What could you possibly want if you find yourself in a popular (but laid back) city beaming with warm locals, friendly expats, and an endless list of awesome activities?
How about taking a break to find a welcoming place that serves a decent drink, like a much-needed cup of tea or coffee?
Well, you’ve still come to the right place then, because Chiang Mai has a booming cafe culture that shows no sign of slowing down!</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>I love the idea of staying in kooky, renovated styles of accommodation. And what I’m about to share with you is a classic example of this.
Snoozebox is a portable hotel, which has recently been a big hit at festivals and events around the UK. What’s their unique selling point, I hear you say? Well, they’ve renovated shipping containers into portable ‘hotel-like’ rooms. Described on their website as a premium style of accommodation, we wasted no time booking a room for our Edinburgh Fringe Festival stay.</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>It has been just over 7 days since we landed in the UK. Squeezing a quick trip to Edinburgh, we dragged ourselves to the bus station to catch a 05:15am Megabus to Manchester, where we were picked up by Kyle’s parents. Within a few hours plenty of hugs were exchanged, our backpacks were thrown down in the spare room, and before I could blink I was back on the sofa with a cuppa’ tea in hand; it was like we had never left.</p>

<p class=py-6>As we prepared for our return to the UK we noticed that the annual Fringe Festival in Edinburgh was on. We always watched the EdFringe comedy highlights on TV, so when we saw that the festival was still on we immediately grasped the opportunity and booked a connecting flight from London Heathrow to Edinburgh!
This isn’t our first time in Edinburgh; back in 2013 we visited the city for Hogmanay (New Years Eve).</p>

<p class=py-6>It was difficult to say goodbye to Chiang Mai, our temporary home for the past 2 months. But it was that time again to pack up our belongings and move on to Bangkok – our last destination in Asia.
We boarded an early morning train from Chiang Mai; it took around 12 hours to reach the Thai capital. Foreseeing that this was our last mode of transportation, we were welcomed by a constant stream of cockroaches feeding through the train walls, the toilet ‘aromas’ were enough to make the sturdiest of souls shed a tear, and the food served at lunch lingered an after scent of microwaved mackerel and over boiled eggs in the air.</p>

<p class=py-6>Chiang Mai is one of the last places we’re visiting before we return to the UK. It’s been just over a month since we landed and settled in an AirBnB apartment, and I can honestly say that I feel just as comfortable here as I did back at home, if not better.
Back in the UK we’re accustomed to paying a lot more when it comes to renting an apartment, using public transport and doing social activities.</p>

<p class=py-6>Meditation has always been somewhat of an enigma to me. The irony of wanting to learn about this technique but not being committed because there’s **always more important/busy things to do.**Does this sound familiar?
Out of curiosity I researched into meditation courses in Chiang Mai and came across a site which provided weekly one night meditation retreats; Monk Chat Meditation is located at Wat Suan Dok and also offers weekly ‘Monk Chats’.</p>

<p class=py-6>If you asked me 6 months ago ‘So, do you have a favourite country?’ I wouldn’t have been able to answer the question. That is until, I visited Japan.
We explored Japan for 3 weeks, which in my opinion wasn’t enough time. We literally missed the cherry blossom season when we arrived, and due to our busy itinerary we didn’t get to experience an onsen. But despite this, we were blown away by Japan’s immense beauty and culture.</p>

It’s that time again, or should I say ‘occasion’ where we’ve reached another milestone. It has been one year since we waved goodbye to England in return for a years’ long Asian adventure. Only one problem…that ‘year’ practically flew by!
I find it very surreal to believe we have been away from home for 12 months. I remember how I felt when I left the UK, all those fears and nerves about the unknown.</p>

It doesn’t matter if you’re on a quick visit or staying longer than one week, don’t miss the opportunity to try out these delicious foods during your stay!
1. Dim Sum
There is only one place which is worth waiting for to try dim sum. Tim Ho Wan Dim Sum Specialists is one of the cheapest Michelin star restaurants in the city which attracts huge queues every day.</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>Just over 65km away from Hong Kong lies the small city of Macau. This pint-sized city is brimming with history; Macau was a Portuguese colony and one of the first settlements for Europeans in Asia. The Portuguese flair combined with Oriental influences moulded Macau as a classic city of ‘East meets West’. However over recent years Macau is also known as the ‘Vegas of Asia’ which astonishingly generates more revenue from gambling than Las Vegas itself!</p>

<p class=py-6>Hong Kong is one of the busiest, liveliest atmospheres I’ve visited. After a few days the constant buzz started to wear us out, so we took a mini excursion to Lantau island.
We planned to spend a whole day on the island however we overslept so only spent a few hours in the afternoon exploring!
Getting there
I look scared but I’m not, honest!
The weather was dreary so we took the cable car to the island.</p>

Soon after landing I noticed the initial buzz about the place.</p>

<p class=py-6>We stayed in South Korea for 3 weeks – by the time we reached Seoul the media were in a frenzy about the recent outbreak of MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome).
Here’s my two cents/pennies/won/whatever! about this recent outbreak…
What is MERS?
MERS is a viral respiratory disease which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Symptoms from the disease can range from an infection like a cold to more serious illnesses like respiratory failure and pneumonia.</p>

N Seoul Tower opened in 1980 and has become a popular landmark for Seoul. The facilities at the Tower include an observatory, a roof terrace and a variety of restaurants.
There are 3 options to get to the Tower – walk, bus or cable car.</p>

<p class=py-6>We only stopped in Daegu for a couple of nights as we were meeting up with a friend (who we met on a cooking class in Chiang Mai).
Again we booked another ‘love hotel’ as they’re usually the cheapest types of accommodation. Unlike Busan this one had a really tacky feel but given the location it sufficed.

Still feeling burned out from our experience in Busan we didn’t really explore Daegu much.</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>I can’t quite sum up my feelings towards Busan. We were only there for 2 nights but I couldn’t engage with the city.
As soon as we passed through immigration and exited the port I felt an immediate sense of disappointment. I thought to myself ‘Why are you feeling so down, you’ve just got here!’
Then it struck me. I was subconsciously comparing Busan to Japan. Which is of course not fair to do at all, but everything I saw came with a reflex of ‘but in Japan it’s like this’ or ‘I preferred how its done in Japan’.</p>

So. Here we are. It is now that time to bid another farewell to this country in exchange for another. However unlike my usual excited nerves at the thought of moving on, I can’t help but feel absolutely gutted to be leaving Japan.
Three awesome weeks have flown by, much to my disappointment. There just didn’t seem to be enough hours in the day to do what we wanted; we saw as much as we could but I still feel like we didn’t even scrape Japan’s surface.</p>

What I liked most about Fukuoka was the laid back vibe. Unlike Tokyo or Osaka, you get a great feel of city life without the mass crowds.</p>

We took a day trip from Osaka to visit Kobe which took a little over 1 hour to reach by train. Conveniently reaching before noon, we made our way to Kobe Ishidayarestaurant where we had reserved seats for the lunch special.</p>

Kyoto is as traditional as it gets; here you will find ancient temples, majestic gardens, traditional ceremonies and geisha. There is plenty to see here and depending on which season you visit you’re guaranteed to see some wonderful scenery.

1. Be up ridiculously early to see the famous tuna auctions
2. Queue up for a delicious sushi breakfast
Reading recent articles about the tuna auctions, most were suggesting that a 2am arrival is the earliest you’d need to be there as there are a limited number of people allowed at the auctions.</p>

<p class=py-6>We stayed in Tokyo for a little over one week and mainly covered the popular districts. Although we didn’t stray too far from the tourist path, I found that each district had its own personality and flair.
Tokyo is a densely populated city which can take some getting used to. If you enjoy city life (like me) then you’re in for a great time. That being said there is a calmer side to Tokyo; there are many well maintained parks to spend an afternoon at, and districts like Kita (where we stayed) are much more laid back and local.</p>

Our visa on arrival granted us 30 days to explore the Philippines. We visited Cebu, Moalboal, Oslob, Bohol, and Boracay. This sounds like a lot of places to visit, but the truth is we’ve barely scratched the surface. There are over 7,000 islands in the Philippines, boasting some of the world’s best beaches and natural wonders in South East Asia.</p>

It wasn’t easy, but we chose Boracay. We weren’t keen on the touristy side but we were intrigued to see the beaches (White Beach is known to be one of the best beaches in the world).</p>

Cebu is also a great base to explore beaches, nature and wildlife. Cebu has one of the country’s busiest ferry ports with regular vessel services to nearby islands and longer distant routes to islands such as Manila.</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>Please note when I mention Bali in this post I’m referring to the beach locations Kuta and Seminyak. I’m not referring to other parts of the island – especially Ubud which I absolutely loved!
The beaches of Bali and the Gili Islands are regularly frequented by visitors around the globe in search for sun, sea and sand. _Aaand…_if you all want is sun, sea and sand then I guess you’ll have a great time.</p>

1.Gregorian calendar – observing New Years day as January 1st. We celebrated 2015 New Years in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
2.Chinese Lunar New Year – falls on the months of January or February. This year the celebrations for 2015 Lunar New Year fell on February 19th. We celebrated the ‘Year of the Sheep’ in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia.
3.And now – Balinese New Year (known as “Caka Year) which falls during the month of March.</p>

<p class=py-6>After the horrendous experience from Mount Bromo we desperately clinged onto hopes that Bali would heal our negative minds. We settled on visiting Ubud for a week for some much-needed rest and recoup – we weren’t ready to take on the beaches just yet.
I’ve seen countless travel articles and blogs confessing a profound love for Ubud. Coincidently I’m reading Elizabeth Gilbert’s ‘Eat Pray Love’ – I’ve even waited till Ubud to read the last section!</p>

<p class=py-6>We popped into a tour operator in Jogja and booked a 2 day/1 night tour to Bali via Mount Bromo. Seeing as we were travelling to Bali we thought we were being savvy with a quick detour to Bromo. Looking back, I wish we had put more effort into our decision.
Here’s why…
The day started well. The minibus arrived on time at our guesthouse. We spent most of the day on the minibus travelling to Probollingo.</p>

We arrived in Yogyakarta by train from Jakarta. The train departed around 9am and took around 7 hours.The city is relatively small but easy to navigate – especially if you can ride a motorcycle.</p>

<p class=py-6>So far on our travels we’ve mainly kept to budget by staying in basic accommodation. However when we arrived in Singapore there was one expense we paid the price for – to spend one night at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
Not only is the Marina Bay Sands hotel an icon for Singapore, it also homes the worlds famous rooftop infinity pool. I remember seeing a photo of the infinity pool in a travel magazine years ago and remember thinking, I will go to Singapore in the future AND I’ll make it my mission to stay at this hotel!</p>

<p class=py-6>There no doubt about it… Singapore is much wealthier,a hella’ lot cleaner, and 1000x more stylish than its Asian neighbours. This pint size island is one of the largest global commercial hubs and was recently crowned as the world’s most expensive city to live in (according to this BBC May 2015 article).
Singapore has been labelled ‘Singabore’ over the years for various reasons. One may be due to the countless ‘No-No-No’ signs backed up by tough laws and restrictions.</p>

The Cameron Highlands is easily recognised as the home of Malaysia’s Boh tea plantation. Amongst the wealth of tea available in this region there are plenty of strawberry farms, bee farms and varied hiking routes.
Our stay in the highlands was brief so we decided to make the most of our time and booked a half day tour with Eco Cameron Travel Tours.</p>

We stayed in Pantai Cenang, the main beach town on the island.
Langkawi was given a tax-free status in 1987 in a bid to encourage tourism and improve local living standards.</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>It was that time again where our 2 month visa was nearly up and once again we were looking forward to the prospect of visiting another country.
Still challenging overland transportation we researched the best place in Thailand for onward travel to Malaysia. We found Hat Yai to be a popular hub for onwards travel to Malaysia so we made arrangements to go there by bus the next day. There is a regular service which runs from Krabi to Hat Yai and we had no problems booking a ticket on the day of travel.</p>

<p class=py-6>We’ve seen our share of overhyped, touristy beach destinations in Thailand during our travels. It was time to go somewhere that retained its charm and authenticity. Welcome to Ko Lanta!
It took around 90 minutes by ferry to reach Ko Lanta from Koh Phi Phi Don. It was just starting to rain as we arrived but we remained optimistic. We were picked up at the port and taken to our hotel Lanta Just Come where we stayed for a few nights.</p>

<p class=py-6>When most people think of Thailand they think of the film ‘The Beach’. The film’s location was filmed at Maya Bay on Ko Phi Phi Le. The success of the film threw Maya Bay into the spotlight as one of Thailand’s most visited destination.
We decided against a tour and wanted to find a long tail boat that’d take us there ourselves. We’ve heard how crowded Maya Bay gets and we wanted to go on our watch before it gets too busy.</p>

It took 1 hour to get to Patong from Phuket by local bus. It was clear as we arrived how popular Patong was. Big Western chains have flooded this once idyllic town; there are mass shopping outlets selling the standard ‘same same’ merchandise ranging from souvenirs, clothing, and fake designer goods.</p>

<p class=py-6>Tigers. _‘King of the Jungle’ – as the saying goes._Something which the majority of the world’s population adore, admire and respect. At least that’s what I thought, until I visited Tiger Kingdom.
Tigers are powerful, they are hunters, they fight for their territory. But if we had the opportunity to be near these animals? Maybe even going as far as touching them?
Well this is where Tiger Kingdom fits the bill (apparently) by giving visitors the opportunity to enter the enclosure and get up close with a tiger.</p>

Chiang Mai is a popular city in Northern Thailand. The city is renowned for its ancient temples, scenic landscapes and welcoming people. Over the years it has gained popularity and homes a thriving expat community.
It took around 3 hours to reach Chiang Mai on bus (from Chiang Rai). I noticed when we arrived how alive the atmosphere was. It’s been on our bucket list to see the Lantern Festival (Yi Peng) and we had arranged our schedule so we arrived in time for the event.</p>

Siem Reap is easilyrecognised as Cambodia’s most visited region as it is the home to the magnificent Angkor Archaeological park.</p>

The journey so far has been pretty unpleasant; the only seats available on the bus to the border were at the back (where every bump, rattle and thump echoes through my bones). The woman in front of us has wretched her guts out the entire time (trust me, this is last thing you’d want to hear at 6am, whilst swaying side to side on a rickety old bus).</p>

<p class=py-6>I admit it… I was pretty naïve when I landed in Hanoi. I knew very little about Vietnam or its culture, people and way of life. After spending 2 adventurous months travelling down the country’s spine I’ve immersed myself into Vietnam’s lush scenery, received the warmest generosity from locals and eaten the most incredible food.
Vietnam surpassed my expectations and made me realise how versatile and wonderful this country is. I’m glad in a way that Vietnam hasn’t received the same attention as its nearby neighbour Thailand.</p>

Vietnam is an incredibly diverse country. Its food is as much of a highlight as anything else with a variety of local cuisines differing along the country. Now there is plenty of choice in terms of local and international food, and I’m sure everyone that has visited Vietnam has their select favourites they’ll treasure.
Check out my personal favourites I’ll remember during my travels in Vietnam:</p>

Instead of checking into a hotel we opted to go Airbnb and stayed with an expat couple in District 2, a much quieter part of the city but only a 15 minute bus/car journey into District 1.</p>

Mui Ne is still in development as there are a number of construction sites popping up around the area.</p>

Da Nang still has a local feel to the area; we rarely saw other travelers during our 2 night stay. This may be because Da Nang is a tad pricey, we stayed at the Olina Hotel which was a few minutes walk to the beach but a 35-40 minute walk to the city.</p>

We kept the itinerary simple over the days, checking out nearby museums, local eateries and familiarizing ourselves with the area.
I really enjoy the vibe around the Old Quarter as it has something for everyone .</p>

<hr class="border border-t-4 border-gray-400 w-12 my-3">
<p class=py-6>One word to sum up Udaipur? Stunning.
I have fallen in love with Udaipur. Known as the Venice of the East, Udaipur boasts amazing scenery, friendly people, and awesome food.
We visited the City Palace of Udaipur, accompanied by a tour guide. The palace overlooks lake Pichola, and compromises of various towers, terraces, courtyards as gardens. The interior of the palace showcases beautiful artistic imagery, detailed mirror work, and antique furnishings.</p>

<p class=py-6>The city of Jodhpur is a great place to indulge in history and heritage. It is the second largest state in Rajasthan and is known as the blue city due to vivid blue painted buildings sprawled around Mehrangarh Fort.
We visited Meherangah Fort, which is one of the largest forts in India. The majestic fort is 400 feet above the city, and provides spectacular views over the city. We took an audio tour guide which I enjoyed, it’s like having your own private history lesson at your own leisure_.</p>

<p class=py-6>Ahh, Rajasthan! The place of rich heritage and stunning architecture. For me this was a highlight of the tour as this is an area I’ve not previously visited.
Jaipur, known as the Pink City is the largest Indian state in Rajasthan.
Our day began visiting Amber Fort. Located on a hill, the fort combines a beautiful blend of Hindu & Mughal architecture (think red sand stone and white marble). The interior of the palace displays impressive artwork, carvings and mirrored walls.</p>

Tordi Gardh and Nimaj Bagh were both amazing villages we had the privilege of staying at. I thoroughly enjoyed both stays and loved the caring hospitality received by all.

It’s been great spending time in Nepal before we join a tour. It’s given us the chance to adapt to a new climate and another way of living. We’ve had the opportunity to enjoy local cuisine and visit places of interest; to get lost and find our way back to our guesthouse.</p>

Thamel is a popular tourist area in Kathmandu, overflowing with an abundance of energy, colours, and noise. As soon as you arrive on the main stretch for the first time you will experience a sensational overload. Trying to navigate a way to the nearest coffee shop whilst trying not to get run over and rejecting every taxi request/sales pitch/beggar advance following you definitely requires patience and skill!</p>

BUT!
Where do you go first?
Which continent will you be challenging?
How long do you intend to be away for?
And most importantly…
Have you set yourself a budget?
Admittedly when we thought about our travelling plans we got pretty excited and initially thought about visiting Asia, Australia and South America – ALL within one year!</p>

<p class=py-6>The simple answer to this question is a resounding YES!
Choosing which backpackers insurance to go for is far more complicated than we anticipated. It took over 2 weeks to choose the right type of cover – something which we thought would take a day to complete!
It is essential choosing the right insurance – going with the cheapest option is not always your best bet.
Here are a few tips I can recommend for those looking into travel insurance policies:</p>
