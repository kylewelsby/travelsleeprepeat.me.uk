<p>Preparing a travelling adventure is indeed an exciting chapter. There are many variables to consider which (<em>lets face it)</em> can easily be overshadowed by the golden idea to ‘drop everything and leave’…</p>
<p><strong>BUT!</strong></p>
<p><em>Where do you go first?</em></p>
<p><em>Which continent will you be challenging?</em></p>
<p><em>How long do you intend to be away for?</em></p>
<p><em>And most importantly…</em></p>
<p><em>Have you set yourself a budget?</em></p>
<p>Admittedly when we thought about our travelling plans we got <em>pretty</em> excited and initially thought about visiting Asia, Australia and South America – ALL within one year!</p>
<p>However we realised very quickly when we sat down to look into costings that there was no way we’d want to visit all these countries within a year (<em>it’s not that it’s impossible, it’s more of a case that we’d like to pace our travels rather than county hop</em>).</p>
<p>After some thought and consideration, we began to narrow down our list specifically around Asia. We like the idea of spending more time exploring this wonderful continent – and let’s face it there is plenty there to keep us occupied!</p>
<p>Though the idea of travel is having the freedom to go anywhere, I personally think it’s important to have at least <em>some</em> idea of where to go first.</p>
<p>We used that helped us to figure out the basics:</p>
<p>→Choose a destination – this means you have a goal destination to work towards.</p>
<p>→Plan – now a destination has been chosen, the next step can be to book flights, apply for Visas and create a travel itinerary.</p>
<p>→Budget – keep in mind the budget planned. Research whether it’s cheaper to fly into a nearby country and cross borders into another one if it reduces costs. Do consider certain destinations around peak times (Christmas/New Years period or religious festivals) where the cost of activities and hotels will cost more – this is especially the case for beach destinations.</p>
<p>When we chose Nepal as our first destination we felt that our ‘travelling adventure’ became concrete -it became our reality which had its own countdown. This really got us into gear and pushed us in the right direction planning and selling up.</p>
<p>We’re fully aware that the itinerary we’ve created is likely to vary over the course of our journey. That being said, it’s also exciting to know that we have a year ahead visiting most of these countries.</p>
<p>This is how we loosely foresee our travels over the next 12 months:</p>
<p><strong>2014</strong></p>
<p>June & July – Nepal and India</p>
<p>• Our pre-booked Gecko’s tour will start in Kathmandu and will be crossing overland into India where we eventually make our way through various cities and towns to New Delhi.</p>
<p>August & September – Vietnam</p>
<p>• Once the tour is finished we will apply for a Vietnam visa and fly into Hanoi. The initial is to make our way down the country to Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>October – Cambodia</p>
<p>•We’ve estimated a month to spend in Cambodia – this is likely to be shortened as our intentions at the moment are to just visit Angkor Wat Archaeological Park.</p>
<p>October & November – Thailand</p>
<p>• We’re hoping to get a 2 month tourist visa before we enter Thailand so we have time to explore the country.</p>
<p><strong>2014/ 2015</strong></p>
<p>December & January – Malaysia and Singapore</p>
<p>• Malaysia and Singapore are on the itinerary as it’ll be easy to travel overland – there is train which runs from Thailand to Malaysia – and Malaysia to Singapore.</p>
<p>February – Indonesia</p>
<p>• Visas on arrival are valid for a month – our initial intentions are to visit Bali, Ubud and the Lombok.</p>
<p>March – Philippines</p>
<p>• A flight from Indonesia to Japan requires a stop off at Philippines – so we may as well pop in as it’s on the way!</p>
<p>April – Japan</p>
<p>• We’re aware that Japan is expensive so we’re going to decide when we arrive how long we’d like to stay. Tokyo and Kyoto are to-do’s.</p>
<p>May – China</p>
<p>• We’ll be applying for a visa (from wherever we can) but we’re unsure what kind of obstacles may occur (we’ve read that you’ll need to pre-book and provide step by step information). We could potentially book another tour in China to save on VISA complications.</p>
<p>June – Hong Kong</p>
<p>• We predict to be in Hong Kong by June 2014 which will mark 1 year travelling.</p>
<p>If we aren’t ready to go back home after our year anniversary, then we have further plans to visit Australia, New Zealand and Fiji.</p>
<p><em>But that’s a loong way off</em> <em>for now</em> – we want to challenge Asia first!</p>
