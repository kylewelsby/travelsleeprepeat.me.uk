<p>Still feeling burned out from our experience in Busan we didn’t really explore Daegu much. I found from previous experience that whenever we ‘force’ ourselves to go sightseeing we end up having a really crap time. <em>If you have to force yourself to do something you don’t want to, you ain’t gonna have a great time doing it!</em></p>

<p>Anyways the purpose of coming here was to meet our dear friend Rikus. He took us to a local restaurant where we got to try Korean BBQ for the first time, and then introduced us to makgeolli and soju (popular Korean alcoholic beverages).</p>

<p>It’s amazing how catching up with friends can make you feel. We both felt so happy after our catch up with Rikus; it was great just to talk, eat and drink!</p>
<p>We’re actually looking forward to visiting Seoul next; I’ve heard good things about South Korea’s capital so I’m hoping we find some great hangouts during our stay.</p>
