I knew very little about Vietnam or its culture, people and way of life. After spending 2 adventurous months travelling down the country’s spine I’ve immersed myself into Vietnam’s lush scenery, received the warmest generosity from locals and eaten the most incredible food.
Vietnam surpassed my expectations and made me realise how versatile and wonderful this country is. I’m glad in a way that Vietnam hasn’t received the same attention as its nearby neighbour Thailand.</description></item><item><title>Ho Chi Minh &amp;#8211; We&amp;#8217;ve Finally Reached You!</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-10-saigon-weve-finally-reached-you/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 08:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-10-saigon-weve-finally-reached-you/</guid><description>Final bus journey, Mui Ne to Saigon (via The Sinh Tourist)
We embarked on our final bus journey to Saigon, departing from Mui Ne.
As we arrived at the Sinh Tourist office five hours later, it was clear that we were once again back in a major city. Glaring bright lights, frantic motorbikes whizzing in all directions, taxis racing up and down, hawkers galore…yep, welcome to Ho Chi Minh!
Instead of checking into a hotel we opted to go Airbnb and stayed with an expat couple in District 2, a much quieter part of the city but only a 15 minute bus/car journey into District 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
