I knew very little about Vietnam or its culture, people and way of life. After spending 2 adventurous months travelling down the country’s spine I’ve immersed myself into Vietnam’s lush scenery, received the warmest generosity from locals and eaten the most incredible food.
Vietnam surpassed my expectations and made me realise how versatile and wonderful this country is. I’m glad in a way that Vietnam hasn’t received the same attention as its nearby neighbour Thailand.</description></item><item><title>Mui Ne &amp;#8211; The &amp;#8216;Sahara&amp;#8217; of Vietnam</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-09-the-sahara-of-vietnam-mui-ne/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 15:02:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-09-the-sahara-of-vietnam-mui-ne/</guid><description>Mui Ne is a coastal town in the South east region of Vietnam. We got the bus from Da Lat to Mui Ne which took about 5 hours. The roads are in a desperate state of repair and we counted down the hours till we got off the bus, we lost count of how many potholes the bus went over!
Mui Ne is still in development as there are a number of construction sites popping up around the area.</description></item></channel></rss>
