Coincidentally it was also the best time to go as the weather had finally cleared up.
N Seoul Tower opened in 1980 and has become a popular landmark for Seoul. The facilities at the Tower include an observatory, a roof terrace and a variety of restaurants.
There are 3 options to get to the Tower – walk, bus or cable car.</description></item><item><title>Don&amp;#8217;t Like Cats?

There are streets around Seoul lined with rows of coffee shop after another.
In recent years a number of quirky cafes have emerged. Cat cafes which seem to be the rage everywhere are not the only quirky cafe you’ll find in Seoul.

At first we weren’t sure how to long to stay but we found a great hostel which had everything we needed for a couple of weeks downtime.
There are many districts in Seoul but we decided to stay in Hongdae, a lively area near Hongik University which had plenty of food, drinking and shopping choices.</description></item></channel></rss>
