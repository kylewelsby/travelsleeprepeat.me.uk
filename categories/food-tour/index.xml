Vietnam is an incredibly diverse country. Its food is as much of a highlight as anything else with a variety of local cuisines differing along the country. Now there is plenty of choice in terms of local and international food, and I’m sure everyone that has visited Vietnam has their select favourites they’ll treasure.
Check out my personal favourites I’ll remember during my travels in Vietnam:</description></item><item><title>An evening with Hanoi Street Food tour</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-street-food-tour/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2014 08:47:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-street-food-tour/</guid><description>A couple days after settling into our new surroundings and hotel we booked ourselves on a street food tour. I found the tour via TripAdvisor and after a couple of quick friendly emails we were booked for the next day. We opted for the 17:00 start departing at the tour office. The price per person is 20$.
Our guide for the evening was Sea, a fun quirky guy who kept us entertained throughout our time.</description></item><item><title>An Evening with Indian Food Tours</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-an-evening-with-indian-food-tours/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2014 18:05:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-an-evening-with-indian-food-tours/</guid><description>Following a successful day of shopping we went on a food tour in the evening with Indian Food Tours in Delhi.
Our guide was Jaidev, a very knowledgable guy who knew so much about Delhi’s history and took us to food establishments we would have never otherwise found.
Exploring by foot and rickshaw we ventured into Old Delhi and ate so much – tasty samosas, spicy chicken skewers, lassi, sweet pastries and curries to name a few!</description></item></channel></rss>
