There are plenty of tour agents near the port that offer fixed prices. The price was roughly 66 MYR for a one way ticket, and around 123 MYR for a return ticket.
The ferry only takes around 2 hours from Penang to Langkawi
We stayed in Pantai Cenang, the main beach town on the island.
Langkawi was given a tax-free status in 1987 in a bid to encourage tourism and improve local living standards.</description></item></channel></rss>
