I knew very little about Vietnam or its culture, people and way of life. After spending 2 adventurous months travelling down the country’s spine I’ve immersed myself into Vietnam’s lush scenery, received the warmest generosity from locals and eaten the most incredible food.
Vietnam surpassed my expectations and made me realise how versatile and wonderful this country is. I’m glad in a way that Vietnam hasn’t received the same attention as its nearby neighbour Thailand.</description></item><item><title>Homestay in North Sapa</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-homestay-in-north-sapa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2014 10:43:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-homestay-in-north-sapa/</guid><description>Visiting Sapa is a must do for anyone travelling around the north of Vietnam. Sapa is home to a rich diversity of rice terraces, lush vegetation and remote hill tribes.There are plenty of travel agencies in Hanoi that can arrange day or night excursions with the choice to stay in hotels or with the locals.
We were recommended by our hotel to book a 2 night home stay in North Sapa (as the North is said to be less touristy than the South).</description></item></channel></rss>
