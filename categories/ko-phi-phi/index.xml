The film’s location was filmed at Maya Bay on Ko Phi Phi Le. The success of the film threw Maya Bay into the spotlight as one of Thailand’s most visited destination.
We decided against a tour and wanted to find a long tail boat that’d take us there ourselves. We’ve heard how crowded Maya Bay gets and we wanted to go on our watch before it gets too busy.</description></item><item><title>The Highs and Lows of Ko Phi Phi Don</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-12-the-highs-and-lows-of-ko-phi-phi-don/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2014 18:14:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-12-the-highs-and-lows-of-ko-phi-phi-don/</guid><description>From Ao Nang we went Ko Phi Phi. We found a tour agency and book ourselves on a ferry for the next day. The price per person for the ferry was 300 baht.
Our tickets for the ferry also included pick up from our guesthouse. We left our guesthouse at 07:00am and jumped into the large songthaew which picked up as many people as possible to take to the port.</description></item></channel></rss>
