How about taking a break to find a welcoming place that serves a decent drink, like a much-needed cup of tea or coffee?
Well, you’ve still come to the right place then, because Chiang Mai has a booming cafe culture that shows no sign of slowing down!</description></item><item><title>One Night In a Shipping Container</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-10-one-night-in-a-shipping-container/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 20:21:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-10-one-night-in-a-shipping-container/</guid><description>I love the idea of staying in kooky, renovated styles of accommodation. And what I’m about to share with you is a classic example of this.
Snoozebox is a portable hotel, which has recently been a big hit at festivals and events around the UK. What’s their unique selling point, I hear you say? Well, they’ve renovated shipping containers into portable ‘hotel-like’ rooms. Described on their website as a premium style of accommodation, we wasted no time booking a room for our Edinburgh Fringe Festival stay.</description></item><item><title>Coming Back to the UK</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-09-coming-back-to-the-uk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 18:22:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-09-coming-back-to-the-uk/</guid><description>It has been just over 7 days since we landed in the UK. Squeezing a quick trip to Edinburgh, we dragged ourselves to the bus station to catch a 05:15am Megabus to Manchester, where we were picked up by Kyle’s parents. Within a few hours plenty of hugs were exchanged, our backpacks were thrown down in the spare room, and before I could blink I was back on the sofa with a cuppa’ tea in hand; it was like we had never left.</description></item><item><title>Laughs Away At Edinburgh&amp;#8217;s Fringe Festival</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-09-laughs-away-at-edinburghs-fringe-festival/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 18:34:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-09-laughs-away-at-edinburghs-fringe-festival/</guid><description>As we prepared for our return to the UK we noticed that the annual Fringe Festival in Edinburgh was on. We always watched the EdFringe comedy highlights on TV, so when we saw that the festival was still on we immediately grasped the opportunity and booked a connecting flight from London Heathrow to Edinburgh!
This isn’t our first time in Edinburgh; back in 2013 we visited the city for Hogmanay (New Years Eve).</description></item><item><title>Bangkok, We Meet Again&amp;#8230;</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-bangkok-we-meet-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 18:41:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-bangkok-we-meet-again/</guid><description>It was difficult to say goodbye to Chiang Mai, our temporary home for the past 2 months. But it was that time again to pack up our belongings and move on to Bangkok – our last destination in Asia.
We boarded an early morning train from Chiang Mai; it took around 12 hours to reach the Thai capital. Foreseeing that this was our last mode of transportation, we were welcomed by a constant stream of cockroaches feeding through the train walls, the toilet ‘aromas’ were enough to make the sturdiest of souls shed a tear, and the food served at lunch lingered an after scent of microwaved mackerel and over boiled eggs in the air.</description></item><item><title>Why Chiang Mai is My &amp;#8216;Home Away From Home&amp;#8217;</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-why-chiang-mai-is-my-home-away-from-home/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2015 10:23:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-why-chiang-mai-is-my-home-away-from-home/</guid><description>Chiang Mai is one of the last places we’re visiting before we return to the UK. It’s been just over a month since we landed and settled in an AirBnB apartment, and I can honestly say that I feel just as comfortable here as I did back at home, if not better.
Back in the UK we’re accustomed to paying a lot more when it comes to renting an apartment, using public transport and doing social activities.</description></item><item><title>Reflections from a Vipassana Meditation Retreat</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-reflections-from-a-vipassana-meditation-retreat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 10:17:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-reflections-from-a-vipassana-meditation-retreat/</guid><description>Meditation has always been somewhat of an enigma to me. The irony of wanting to learn about this technique but not being committed because there’s **always more important/busy things to do.**Does this sound familiar?
Out of curiosity I researched into meditation courses in Chiang Mai and came across a site which provided weekly one night meditation retreats; Monk Chat Meditation is located at Wat Suan Dok and also offers weekly ‘Monk Chats’.</description></item><item><title>20 Things I Love About Japan</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-20-things-i-love-about-japan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 13:53:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-08-20-things-i-love-about-japan/</guid><description>If you asked me 6 months ago ‘So, do you have a favourite country?’ I wouldn’t have been able to answer the question. That is until, I visited Japan.
We explored Japan for 3 weeks, which in my opinion wasn’t enough time. We literally missed the cherry blossom season when we arrived, and due to our busy itinerary we didn’t get to experience an onsen. But despite this, we were blown away by Japan’s immense beauty and culture.</description></item><item><title>Reflecting on One Year of Travel</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-reflecting-on-one-year-of-travel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 18:57:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-reflecting-on-one-year-of-travel/</guid><description>N’aaw, look how cute we looked
It’s that time again, or should I say ‘occasion’ where we’ve reached another milestone. It has been one year since we waved goodbye to England in return for a years’ long Asian adventure. Only one problem…that ‘year’ practically flew by!
I find it very surreal to believe we have been away from home for 12 months. I remember how I felt when I left the UK, all those fears and nerves about the unknown.</description></item><item><title>5 Must Eat Places To Try in Hong Kong</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-5-must-eat-places-to-try-in-hong-kong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 18:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-5-must-eat-places-to-try-in-hong-kong/</guid><description>There’s no such thing as a ‘diet’ in Hong Kong due to the copious amounts of incredible food available in this mini mega city.
It doesn’t matter if you’re on a quick visit or staying longer than one week, don’t miss the opportunity to try out these delicious foods during your stay!
1. Dim Sum
There is only one place which is worth waiting for to try dim sum. Tim Ho Wan Dim Sum Specialists is one of the cheapest Michelin star restaurants in the city which attracts huge queues every day.</description></item><item><title>Macau &amp;#8211; Where East Meets West</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-macau-where-east-meets-west/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015 18:40:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-macau-where-east-meets-west/</guid><description>Just over 65km away from Hong Kong lies the small city of Macau. This pint-sized city is brimming with history; Macau was a Portuguese colony and one of the first settlements for Europeans in Asia. The Portuguese flair combined with Oriental influences moulded Macau as a classic city of ‘East meets West’. However over recent years Macau is also known as the ‘Vegas of Asia’ which astonishingly generates more revenue from gambling than Las Vegas itself!</description></item><item><title>Escaping to Lantau Island</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-escaping-to-lantau-island/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 18:05:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-07-escaping-to-lantau-island/</guid><description>Hong Kong is one of the busiest, liveliest atmospheres I’ve visited. After a few days the constant buzz started to wear us out, so we took a mini excursion to Lantau island.
We planned to spend a whole day on the island however we overslept so only spent a few hours in the afternoon exploring!
Getting there
I look scared but I’m not, honest!
The weather was dreary so we took the cable car to the island.</description></item><item><title>5 Must Do&amp;#8217;s In The Mega City: Hong Kong</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-5-must-dos-in-the-mega-city-hong-kong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2015 18:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-5-must-dos-in-the-mega-city-hong-kong/</guid><description>I’ve wandered through Bangkok’s buzzing night markets, admired Singapore’s squeaky clean streets, marvelled at Tokyo’s neon glory, and gotten lost in Seoul’s quirky neighbourhoods. Still, nothing prepared me for Hong Kong…
Hong Kong has always been an enigma for me. Despite knowing it as one of Asia’s booming mega cities I had difficulty imagining what the city would be like.
Soon after landing I noticed the initial buzz about the place.</description></item><item><title>Visiting South Korea During MERS</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-visiting-south-korea-during-mers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2015 18:38:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-visiting-south-korea-during-mers/</guid><description>We stayed in South Korea for 3 weeks – by the time we reached Seoul the media were in a frenzy about the recent outbreak of MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome).
Here’s my two cents/pennies/won/whatever! about this recent outbreak…
What is MERS?
MERS is a viral respiratory disease which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Symptoms from the disease can range from an infection like a cold to more serious illnesses like respiratory failure and pneumonia.</description></item><item><title>Declaring Our Love at N Seoul Tower</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-declaring-our-love-at-n-seoul-tower/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2015 10:54:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-declaring-our-love-at-n-seoul-tower/</guid><description>We waited until our last day in Seoul to visit N Seoul Tower. Coincidentally it was also the best time to go as the weather had finally cleared up.
N Seoul Tower opened in 1980 and has become a popular landmark for Seoul. The facilities at the Tower include an observatory, a roof terrace and a variety of restaurants.
There are 3 options to get to the Tower – walk, bus or cable car.</description></item><item><title>Don&amp;#8217;t Like Cats?

There are streets around Seoul lined with rows of coffee shop after another.
In recent years a number of quirky cafes have emerged. Cat cafes which seem to be the rage everywhere are not the only quirky cafe you’ll find in Seoul. I recently discovered there was a dog cafe in Hapjeong as well as a sheep cafe in Hongdae!Take that kitties with your sneeze inducing fur!</description></item><item><title>Catching Up in Daegu</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-catching-up-in-daegu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 18:08:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-catching-up-in-daegu/</guid><description>We only stopped in Daegu for a couple of nights as we were meeting up with a friend (who we met on a cooking class in Chiang Mai).
Again we booked another ‘love hotel’ as they’re usually the cheapest types of accommodation. Unlike Busan this one had a really tacky feel but given the location it sufficed.
Our cheesy room at Prince Motel
Still feeling burned out from our experience in Busan we didn’t really explore Daegu much.</description></item><item><title>Mixed Feelings About Busan</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-mixed-feelings-about-busan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2015 18:37:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-mixed-feelings-about-busan/</guid><description>I can’t quite sum up my feelings towards Busan. We were only there for 2 nights but I couldn’t engage with the city.
As soon as we passed through immigration and exited the port I felt an immediate sense of disappointment. I thought to myself ‘Why are you feeling so down, you’ve just got here!’
Then it struck me. I was subconsciously comparing Busan to Japan. Which is of course not fair to do at all, but everything I saw came with a reflex of ‘but in Japan it’s like this’ or ‘I preferred how its done in Japan’.</description></item><item><title>Sailing to South Korea</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-sailing-to-south-korea/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:58:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-sailing-to-south-korea/</guid><description>Aand by sailing, I mean catching the ferry from Fukuoka to Busan.
Stocking up on essentials
So. Here we are. It is now that time to bid another farewell to this country in exchange for another. However unlike my usual excited nerves at the thought of moving on, I can’t help but feel absolutely gutted to be leaving Japan.
Three awesome weeks have flown by, much to my disappointment. There just didn’t seem to be enough hours in the day to do what we wanted; we saw as much as we could but I still feel like we didn’t even scrape Japan’s surface.</description></item><item><title>Final Days In Fukuoka</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-final-days-in-fukuoka/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2015 18:14:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-final-days-in-fukuoka/</guid><description>After a scenic 4 hour bus ride from Hiroshima we arrived at Fukuoka.
We didn’t really know much about Fukuoka apart from the fact that it had a port which we are intending to use to get to South Korea. However rest assured thereis plenty to do – if you go out in search for it!
What I liked most about Fukuoka was the laid back vibe. Unlike Tokyo or Osaka, you get a great feel of city life without the mass crowds.</description></item><item><title>Hiroshima &amp;#8211; A Sombre Lesson In The Pursuit Of Peace</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-hiroshima-a-sombre-lesson-in-the-pursuit-of-peace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 18:56:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-hiroshima-a-sombre-lesson-in-the-pursuit-of-peace/</guid><description>Our travels in Japan wouldn’t have been complete visiting Hiroshima. Infamously known as the city destroyed by an atomic bomb in WW2, Hiroshima rose from its ruins and rebuilt itself to now become a proclaimed ‘City of Peace’.
Our stay in Japan was nearly coming to an end so we only stayed in Hiroshima for one night. We arrived early morning by night bus – about 7am. By the time we stored our bags in lockers and ate breakfast the Sightseeing bus began its service for the day.</description></item><item><title>Tasting Kobe Beef and Sake For The First Time</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-tasting-kobe-beef-and-sake-for-the-first-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2015 18:41:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-tasting-kobe-beef-and-sake-for-the-first-time/</guid><description>Japan doesn’t fall short when it comes to quality, and the city of Kobe is a prime example of this. There is no better place than Kobe to indulge in two of Japan’s finest delights – Kobe beef and sake.
We took a day trip from Osaka to visit Kobe which took a little over 1 hour to reach by train. Conveniently reaching before noon, we made our way to Kobe Ishidayarestaurant where we had reserved seats for the lunch special.</description></item><item><title>Why One Night in Osaka Isn&amp;#8217;t Enough</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-why-one-night-in-osaka-isnt-enough/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 18:15:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-why-one-night-in-osaka-isnt-enough/</guid><description>I wish we didn’t listen to other travelers saying Osaka wasn’t worth spending more than 1 night, because I left Osaka feeling like I hadn’t seen enough.
We arrived in Osaka late afternoon (after our mini excursion to Nara). After dropping our bags off we headed straight to Dotonbori which is the main entertainment district. We timed it just right as it approached evening; the atmosphere was electric with plenty going on.</description></item><item><title>Nippin&amp;#8217; into Nara</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-nippin-into-nara/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 18:20:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-nippin-into-nara/</guid><description>On our way to Osaka we popped into Nara for one reason only – to see some deer!
It took over 1 hour from Kyoto to arrive by local train. We threw our bags into a locker at the train station and spent a couple of hours sightseeing.
According to Shinto legend the deer are considered to be messengers of god and have since been considered a national treasure.
It didn’t take long till we met a bunch of deers, freely roaming around.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Kyoto&amp;#8217;s Beautiful Past</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-exploring-kyotos-beautiful-past/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2015 18:01:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-exploring-kyotos-beautiful-past/</guid><description>Kyoto was once the Imperial Capital of Japan for more than 1000 years and is known as the ‘City of Ten Thousand Shrines’.
Kyoto is as traditional as it gets; here you will find ancient temples, majestic gardens, traditional ceremonies and geisha. There is plenty to see here and depending on which season you visit you’re guaranteed to see some wonderful scenery.
At first I didn’t want to leave Tokyo, but after we arrived in Kyoto I welcomed the laid back atmosphere.</description></item><item><title>Breakfast at Tsukiji Fish Market</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-breakfast-at-tsukiji-fish-market/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 23:44:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-breakfast-at-tsukiji-fish-market/</guid><description>What is easily the most visited attraction in Tokyo, the Tsukiji Fish market draws a huge number of visitors each day to do two of the following things:
1. Be up ridiculously early to see the famous tuna auctions
2. Queue up for a delicious sushi breakfast
Reading recent articles about the tuna auctions, most were suggesting that a 2am arrival is the earliest you’d need to be there as there are a limited number of people allowed at the auctions.</description></item><item><title>My 25th Birthday in Tokyo</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-my-25th-birthday-in-tokyo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 19:03:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-my-25th-birthday-in-tokyo/</guid><description>Never did I think that I’d spend my quarter-of-a-century birthday in one of the coolest countries in this world.

I didn’t do anything glamorous or expensive, but that just made my day all the more enjoyable.

Although we didn’t stray too far from the tourist path, I found that each district had its own personality and flair.
Tokyo is a densely populated city which can take some getting used to. If you enjoy city life (like me) then you’re in for a great time. That being said there is a calmer side to Tokyo; there are many well maintained parks to spend an afternoon at, and districts like Kita (where we stayed) are much more laid back and local.</description></item><item><title>When Tokyo Dreams Become A Reality</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-when-tokyo-dreams-become-a-reality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2015 18:00:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-when-tokyo-dreams-become-a-reality/</guid><description>‘One day I’m going to go Japan, and I want it to be as crazy, weird and wonderful as I ever imagined it to be’
Landing in Tokyo
Japan is one of those countries that has always fascinated me. Like so many others, there’s just something intriguing about this country.
Tokyo in particular had always stood for to me; the desire to stand amidst the chaos of moving bodies, absorbing the cityscape in all its neon glory.</description></item><item><title>Leaving the Philippines</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-leaving-the-philippines/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 18:04:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-leaving-the-philippines/</guid><description>It’s been a whirlwind month around this wonderful country, and as always I can’t quite get over how quickly time seems to pass before we’re making arrangements for the next destination.
Our visa on arrival granted us 30 days to explore the Philippines. We visited Cebu, Moalboal, Oslob, Bohol, and Boracay. This sounds like a lot of places to visit, but the truth is we’ve barely scratched the surface. There are over 7,000 islands in the Philippines, boasting some of the world’s best beaches and natural wonders in South East Asia.</description></item><item><title>Is Boracay Worth Visiting?</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-is-boracay-worth-visiting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 18:11:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-05-is-boracay-worth-visiting/</guid><description>We had a tough decision to make – do we visit Boracay or Palawan?
Both were a flight away, and both had their own reasons to visit. Palawan had picture postcard scenery and incredible natural wonders. Boracay is the most developed beach island in Philippines, but is renowned for its glorious white sands and serene sunsets.
It wasn’t easy, but we chose Boracay. We weren’t keen on the touristy side but we were intrigued to see the beaches (White Beach is known to be one of the best beaches in the world).</description></item><item><title>The 3 Things You Cannot Miss In Bohol</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-the-3-things-you-cannot-miss-in-bohol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 18:19:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-the-3-things-you-cannot-miss-in-bohol/</guid><description>Bohol is only a 2 hour ferry ride from Cebu. There is no reason not to visit this wonderful island; it is brimming with natural wonders to entice even the fussiest of traveler.
There are plenty of activities to get involved in and around Bohol but for me there were 3 main things I wanted to see.
We only stayed in Bohol for 4 nights, but regardless of how long you stay be sure to include these on your list!</description></item><item><title>Whale Shark Watching in Oslob</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-whale-shark-watching-in-oslob/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 18:49:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-whale-shark-watching-in-oslob/</guid><description>During our stay in Cebu we were recommend many times by locals to visit Oslob to see the whale sharks.
We weren’t really that keen to visit at first because we didn’t know whether this activity would be worthwhile.
We only decided to go last-minute because we went back to Moalboal for another weekend break (yes we liked Moalboal that much we went back again!). We aimed to visit Oslob and Kawasan Falls on the morning we checked out, and then return to Cebu in the afternoon.</description></item><item><title>A Weekend In Moalboal</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-a-weekend-away-in-moalboal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 18:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-a-weekend-away-in-moalboal/</guid><description>It’s super easy to get to Moalboal from Cebu City, so we planned a weekend break during our stay in Cebu.
From Cebu City we headed to the South Bus terminal and waited for the yellow Ceres bus to Moalboal. It gets very busy on weekends and we were queueing for at least hour before we boarded. Be ready to push your way on though because it is literally first come first serve – and people will barge you out the way to get a seat!</description></item><item><title>Visiting Cebu &amp;#8211; The Queen City of the South</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-visiting-cebu-the-queen-city-of-the-south/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2015 18:42:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-visiting-cebu-the-queen-city-of-the-south/</guid><description>We start off our Filipino adventures in Cebu which is located in the Central Visayas. Cebu is the 2nd largest city in the Philippines.
Love how colourful the currency is!
Kyle had a few work commitments to catch up with so we visited Cebu first as we knew there were coworking spaces available.
Cebu is also a great base to explore beaches, nature and wildlife. Cebu has one of the country’s busiest ferry ports with regular vessel services to nearby islands and longer distant routes to islands such as Manila.</description></item><item><title>Why The Beaches in Bali And Gili T Are Overrated</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-why-the-beaches-in-bali-and-gili-t-are-overrated/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2015 18:09:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-04-why-the-beaches-in-bali-and-gili-t-are-overrated/</guid><description>Please note when I mention Bali in this post I’m referring to the beach locations Kuta and Seminyak. I’m not referring to other parts of the island – especially Ubud which I absolutely loved!
The beaches of Bali and the Gili Islands are regularly frequented by visitors around the globe in search for sun, sea and sand. _Aaand…_if you all want is sun, sea and sand then I guess you’ll have a great time.</description></item><item><title>Bali&amp;#8217;s Day Of Silence &amp;#8211; Nyepi Festival 2015</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-03-balis-day-of-silence-nyepi-festival-2015/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2015 07:49:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-03-balis-day-of-silence-nyepi-festival-2015/</guid><description>So far on our travels we have celebrated our 3rd New Year!
1.Gregorian calendar – observing New Years day as January 1st. We celebrated 2015 New Years in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
2.Chinese Lunar New Year – falls on the months of January or February. This year the celebrations for 2015 Lunar New Year fell on February 19th. We celebrated the ‘Year of the Sheep’ in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia.

We settled on visiting Ubud for a week for some much-needed rest and recoup – we weren’t ready to take on the beaches just yet.
I’ve seen countless travel articles and blogs confessing a profound love for Ubud. Coincidently I’m reading Elizabeth Gilbert’s ‘Eat Pray Love’ – I’ve even waited till Ubud to read the last section!</description></item><item><title>Yogyakarta &amp;#8211; Indonesia&amp;#8217;s Cultural Capital</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-03-yogyakarta-indonesias-cultural-capital/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2015 18:57:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-03-yogyakarta-indonesias-cultural-capital/</guid><description>Pronounced Jogjakarta and commonly called ‘Jogja’ or ‘Yogya’ is Indonesia’s thriving cultural scene. Visitors can get involved in an array of activities ranging from traditional music, batik art and handicrafts. Interestingly it is also the only city in Indonesia where a sultan still resides (and even recognised by the Government!)
We arrived in Yogyakarta by train from Jakarta. The train departed around 9am and took around 7 hours.The city is relatively small but easy to navigate – especially if you can ride a motorcycle.</description></item><item><title>Trekkin&amp;#8217; Taman Negara National Park</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-trekkin-in-taman-negara-national-park/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2015 18:15:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-trekkin-in-taman-negara-national-park/</guid><description>Taman Negara is estimated to be over 130 million years old and has a reputation as being one of worlds oldest rainforest. Further research has suggested that the rainforest had not even been affected by the Ice Age!
From the Cameron Highlands we booked a minivan to Jerantut and switched to a boat to reach Kuala Tahan. At Jerantut we purchased compulsory camera permits for 5 MYR.
We always start off optimistic!</description></item><item><title>Why Langkawi Is My Favourite Beach Retreat</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-what-do-i-love-about-langkawi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2015 18:53:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-what-do-i-love-about-langkawi/</guid><description>From Penang we booked ferry tickets to Langkawi. There are plenty of tour agents near the port that offer fixed prices. The price was roughly 66 MYR for a one way ticket, and around 123 MYR for a return ticket.
The ferry only takes around 2 hours from Penang to Langkawi
We stayed in Pantai Cenang, the main beach town on the island.
Langkawi was given a tax-free status in 1987 in a bid to encourage tourism and improve local living standards.</description></item><item><title>The Search for Penangs&amp;#8217; Famous Assam Laksa</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-the-search-for-penangs-famous-assam-laksa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2015 20:47:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-the-search-for-penangs-famous-assam-laksa/</guid><description>According to a 2011 CNN article titled ‘World’s 50 Best Foods’ Penang’s very own Assam Laksa features in at number 7.
Assam laksa is described as a sour-spicy-fruity mackerel broth combining a melody of ingredients including (but not limited) the following: tamarind, mint, chilli, lemongrass, turmeric, cucumber, onion, pineapple and some noodles thrown in for good measure. Intrigued by the article, I did a little more research which singled out one particular stall renowned for serving this particular laksa.</description></item><item><title>Penang: Where History, Street Art and Food Unite</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-penang-where-history-street-art-and-food-unite/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2015 18:20:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-penang-where-history-street-art-and-food-unite/</guid><description>We booked an Aeroline bus from Kuala Lumpur to get to Penang.
The journey was only 4 hours and the bus was surprisingly comfy – our leather seats fully reclined, snacks and headphones were provided and the individual TVs (at the back of each seat like on a plane) had a decent choice of films. There was even a toilet onboard – and it was clean!
We reached Georgetown in the afternoon and checked into the (conveniently named) Kimberley’s Guesthouse for a few nights.</description></item><item><title>Why I Love Kuala Lumpur</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-heres-why-i-love-kuala-lumpur/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2015 18:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-02-heres-why-i-love-kuala-lumpur/</guid><description>When we arrived in Kuala Lumpur in time for Christmas and New Year, we were delighted to find familiar comforts to rest and recuperate for a while – we felt that after 6 months of travel it was time to take a breather.

It’s been 6 months since we left our routine lifestyle in the UK and started our Asian adventure. As I sit here in Kuala Lumpur trying to sum up my thoughts into a post, it’s surreal to think how far we have come and what we’ve accomplished.
Traveling has been an eye-opening, first hand educational experience for me which continues to spark my curiosity and excitement.</description></item><item><title>Why should you go to Vietnam?</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-10-why-should-you-go-to-vietnam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2014 07:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-10-why-should-you-go-to-vietnam/</guid><description>I admit it… I was pretty naïve when I landed in Hanoi. I knew very little about Vietnam or its culture, people and way of life. After spending 2 adventurous months travelling down the country’s spine I’ve immersed myself into Vietnam’s lush scenery, received the warmest generosity from locals and eaten the most incredible food.
Vietnam surpassed my expectations and made me realise how versatile and wonderful this country is. I’m glad in a way that Vietnam hasn’t received the same attention as its nearby neighbour Thailand.</description></item><item><title>Hello Vietnam!</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-hello-vietnam/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 11:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-08-hello-vietnam/</guid><description>After a comfy flight from New Delhi (via Bangkok) with Thai Airways we landed at Hanoi. With our bags and souvenir box (from India) we found our driver to take us to the hotel.
The drive was pleasant and quick and we arrived at the hotel in under 30 minutes. Travellers are spoilt for choice in Hanoi, there are plenty of hotels/hostels in Hanoi’s Old Quarter, suiting all budgets. We decided to stay at the Tulinh Palace hotel 2, after reading great reviews on Booking.</description></item><item><title>Magnificent Monuments: Agra Fort and the Taj Mahal</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-07-agra/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 22:26:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-07-agra/</guid><description>Our next stop after Varanasi was Agra – home to Agra Fort and the iconic Taj Mahal.
We had a guided tour around Agra Fort in the morning. It was a wonderful fort to walk around and admire. The fort is full of interesting legends and showcases beautiful architecture.

This will be my 3rd visit to India (though the 1st time crossing the border overland).
Being of Indian heritage, I’ve had the opportunity to visit my parents home villages and learn of my family history in 2001 and 2005. I’m intrigued to see how Kyle and the rest of the group will react to India!
India can bring out a range of emotions.</description></item><item><title>Boudhanath Stupa</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-07-boudhanath-stupa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 18:08:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-07-boudhanath-stupa/</guid><description>Boudhanath Stupa is the largest Buddhist stupas in Nepal. Built during the 5th century AD Boudhanath is an important site of pilgrimage and meditation for Nepalis and Tibetan Buddhists. It is considered to be a very spiritual area which was once on an ancient trade route between Nepal and Tibet. In 1979 Boudhnath became a UNESCO Heritage site.
As part of our Gecko’s tour this was one of the first activities we visited.</description></item></channel></rss>
