I knew very little about Vietnam or its culture, people and way of life. After spending 2 adventurous months travelling down the country’s spine I’ve immersed myself into Vietnam’s lush scenery, received the warmest generosity from locals and eaten the most incredible food.
Vietnam surpassed my expectations and made me realise how versatile and wonderful this country is. I’m glad in a way that Vietnam hasn’t received the same attention as its nearby neighbour Thailand.</description></item><item><title>Are we in Russia or Nha Trang?</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-09-are-we-in-russia-or-nha-trang/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 04:51:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-09-are-we-in-russia-or-nha-trang/</guid><description>After our second (and final) 14 hour train journey from Da Nang we finally arrived in Nha Trang.
We found a Mai Linh taxi (we find them to be most reputable) to take us our hotel. We initially booked a few nights at the Golden Summer hotel, but we weren’t happy with the room and the staffs negative attitude. We decided to find another hotel for the night and ended up staying at The Summer hotel.</description></item></channel></rss>
