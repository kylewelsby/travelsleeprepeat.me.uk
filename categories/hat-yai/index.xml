The journey will roughly take around 14 hours. We’re already bored and hungry.
We’re not stranger to long bus journeys so I’m sure we’ll find something to keep us occupied.
I’m glad to be saying bye to Thailand, we’ve enjoyed 2 months in this wonderful country exploring the Northern cities and Southern beaches. But it’s now time to move on.</description></item><item><title>Hat Yai &amp;#8211; Where Booking Transportation Sucks</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-12-hat-yai-the-woes-of-booking-onward-transportation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:42:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-12-hat-yai-the-woes-of-booking-onward-transportation/</guid><description>It was that time again where our 2 month visa was nearly up and once again we were looking forward to the prospect of visiting another country.
Still challenging overland transportation we researched the best place in Thailand for onward travel to Malaysia. We found Hat Yai to be a popular hub for onwards travel to Malaysia so we made arrangements to go there by bus the next day. There is a regular service which runs from Krabi to Hat Yai and we had no problems booking a ticket on the day of travel.</description></item></channel></rss>
