From Cebu City we headed to the South Bus terminal and waited for the yellow Ceres bus to Moalboal. It gets very busy on weekends and we were queueing for at least hour before we boarded. Be ready to push your way on though because it is literally first come first serve – and people will barge you out the way to get a seat!</description></item></channel></rss>
