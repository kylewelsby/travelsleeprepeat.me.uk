Of course, the bus was nothing remotely like a ‘limousine style service’ and was rather a rough, nauseating, severely pot holed ride with overbearing loud karaoke played at random times throughout the 7 hour journey!
Siem Reap is easilyrecognised as Cambodia’s most visited region as it is the home to the magnificent Angkor Archaeological park.</description></item><item><title>Mui Ne &amp;#8211; The &amp;#8216;Sahara&amp;#8217; of Vietnam</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-09-the-sahara-of-vietnam-mui-ne/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 15:02:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-09-the-sahara-of-vietnam-mui-ne/</guid><description>Mui Ne is a coastal town in the South east region of Vietnam. We got the bus from Da Lat to Mui Ne which took about 5 hours. The roads are in a desperate state of repair and we counted down the hours till we got off the bus, we lost count of how many potholes the bus went over!
Mui Ne is still in development as there are a number of construction sites popping up around the area.</description></item></channel></rss>
