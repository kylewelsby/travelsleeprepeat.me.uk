Again we booked another ‘love hotel’ as they’re usually the cheapest types of accommodation. Unlike Busan this one had a really tacky feel but given the location it sufficed.
Our cheesy room at Prince Motel
Still feeling burned out from our experience in Busan we didn’t really explore Daegu much.</description></item><item><title>Mixed Feelings About Busan</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-mixed-feelings-about-busan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2015 18:37:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-mixed-feelings-about-busan/</guid><description>I can’t quite sum up my feelings towards Busan. We were only there for 2 nights but I couldn’t engage with the city.
As soon as we passed through immigration and exited the port I felt an immediate sense of disappointment. I thought to myself ‘Why are you feeling so down, you’ve just got here!’
Then it struck me. I was subconsciously comparing Busan to Japan. Which is of course not fair to do at all, but everything I saw came with a reflex of ‘but in Japan it’s like this’ or ‘I preferred how its done in Japan’.</description></item><item><title>Sailing to South Korea</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-sailing-to-south-korea/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:58:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2015-06-sailing-to-south-korea/</guid><description>Aand by sailing, I mean catching the ferry from Fukuoka to Busan.
Stocking up on essentials
So. Here we are. It is now that time to bid another farewell to this country in exchange for another. However unlike my usual excited nerves at the thought of moving on, I can’t help but feel absolutely gutted to be leaving Japan.
Three awesome weeks have flown by, much to my disappointment. There just didn’t seem to be enough hours in the day to do what we wanted; we saw as much as we could but I still feel like we didn’t even scrape Japan’s surface.</description></item></channel></rss>
