Although we didn’t stray too far from the tourist path, I found that each district had its own personality and flair.
Tokyo is a densely populated city which can take some getting used to. If you enjoy city life (like me) then you’re in for a great time. That being said there is a calmer side to Tokyo; there are many well maintained parks to spend an afternoon at, and districts like Kita (where we stayed) are much more laid back and local.</description></item></channel></rss>
