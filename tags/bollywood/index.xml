The place of rich heritage and stunning architecture. For me this was a highlight of the tour as this is an area Iâ€™ve not previously visited.
Jaipur, known as the Pink City is the largest Indian state in Rajasthan.
Our day began visiting Amber Fort. Located on a hill, the fort combines a beautiful blend of Hindu &amp;amp; Mughal architecture (think red sand stone and white marble). The interior of the palace displays impressive artwork, carvings and mirrored walls.</description></item></channel></rss>
