We weren’t really that keen to visit at first because we didn’t know whether this activity would be worthwhile.
We only decided to go last-minute because we went back to Moalboal for another weekend break (yes we liked Moalboal that much we went back again!). We aimed to visit Oslob and Kawasan Falls on the morning we checked out, and then return to Cebu in the afternoon.</description></item></channel></rss>
