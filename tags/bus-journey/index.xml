From Cebu City we headed to the South Bus terminal and waited for the yellow Ceres bus to Moalboal. It gets very busy on weekends and we were queueing for at least hour before we boarded. Be ready to push your way on though because it is literally first come first serve – and people will barge you out the way to get a seat!</description></item><item><title>Chilled vibes in Phuket Town</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-11-chilled-vibes-in-phuket-town/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 20:23:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-11-chilled-vibes-in-phuket-town/</guid><description>Still challenging overland transportation we booked ourselves a series of buses from Chiang Mai to Phuket. We stayed in Bangkok for a couple of nights before heading down to Phuket.
Bangkok – Phuket – the bus we spent an entire day on
We paid a little extra for a ‘VIP’ bus which departed at 07:00am and took around 12 hours to reach Phuket. We were surprised to find that the bus was pretty decent!</description></item></channel></rss>
