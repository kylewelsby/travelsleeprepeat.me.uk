It was time to go somewhere that retained its charm and authenticity. Welcome to Ko Lanta!
It took around 90 minutes by ferry to reach Ko Lanta from Koh Phi Phi Don. It was just starting to rain as we arrived but we remained optimistic. We were picked up at the port and taken to our hotel Lanta Just Come where we stayed for a few nights.</description></item><item><title>Why I&amp;#8217;ll never return to Tiger Kingdom</title><link>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-11-why-ill-never-return-to-tiger-kingdom/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 18:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk/posts/2014-11-why-ill-never-return-to-tiger-kingdom/</guid><description>Tigers. _‘King of the Jungle’ – as the saying goes._Something which the majority of the world’s population adore, admire and respect. At least that’s what I thought, until I visited Tiger Kingdom.
Tigers are powerful, they are hunters, they fight for their territory. But if we had the opportunity to be near these animals? Maybe even going as far as touching them?
Well this is where Tiger Kingdom fits the bill (apparently) by giving visitors the opportunity to enter the enclosure and get up close with a tiger.</description></item></channel></rss>
