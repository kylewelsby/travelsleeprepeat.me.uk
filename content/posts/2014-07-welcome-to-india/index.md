It’s time to say our goodbyes to Nepal, and cross borders to India. This will be my 3rd visit to India (though the 1st time crossing the border overland).

Being of Indian heritage, I’ve had the opportunity to visit my parents home villages and learn of my family history in 2001 and 2005. I’m intrigued to see how Kyle and the rest of the group will react to India!

India can bring out a range of emotions. There is so much to experience and witness, to enjoy and appreciate. _Let’s not forget the challenges the weather can bring, battling the pollution and endless requests from tuk tuks!_ I’m most looking forward to eating local cuisine and visiting the historical forts and palaces in Rajasthan (which I’ve not visited on previous trips).
