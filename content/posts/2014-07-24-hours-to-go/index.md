…Before we embark on an overland Gecko’s tour from Nepal to India.

This is the itinerary for the 17 days: Chitwan National Park, Lumbini, Varanasi, Agra, Tordi Gardh, Jaipur, Nimaj Bagh, Jodhpur, Udaipur, New Delhi.

It’s been great spending time in Nepal before we join a tour. It’s given us the chance to adapt to a new climate and another way of living. We’ve had the opportunity to enjoy local cuisine and visit places of interest; to get lost and find our way back to our guesthouse. I’ve really enjoyed interacting with the locals whilst attempting to bargain at the markets. I cannot mention how beautiful the scenery is around Nepa. I’ll definitely consider a trekking activity if I pass through Nepal again in my future travels.

I’m glad I’ve had the opportunity to visit Nepal and seeing what it has to offer. It’s been a culture shock but I’ll miss the friendly locals, cheap eats and chaotic atmosphere!
