We only stopped in Daegu for a couple of nights as we were meeting up with a friend (who we met on a [cooking class](/posts/2014-11-we-cook-thai-home-garden-cooking-school) in Chiang Mai).

Again we booked another ‘love hotel’ as they’re usually the cheapest types of accommodation. Unlike Busan this one had a really tacky feel but given the location it sufficed.

Still feeling burned out from our experience in Busan we didn’t really explore Daegu much. I found from previous experience that whenever we ‘force’ ourselves to go sightseeing we end up having a really crap time. _If you have to force yourself to do something you don’t want to, you ain’t gonna have a great time doing it!_

Anyways the purpose of coming here was to meet our dear friend Rikus. He took us to a local restaurant where we got to try Korean BBQ for the first time, and then introduced us to makgeolli and soju (popular Korean alcoholic beverages).

It’s amazing how catching up with friends can make you feel. We both felt so happy after our catch up with Rikus; it was great just to talk, eat and drink!

We’re actually looking forward to visiting Seoul next; I’ve heard good things about South Korea’s capital so I’m hoping we find some great hangouts during our stay.

Putting the smiles back on our faces again!
