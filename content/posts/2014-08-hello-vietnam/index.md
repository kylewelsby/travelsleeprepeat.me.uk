After a comfy flight from New Delhi (via Bangkok) with Thai Airways we landed at Hanoi. With our bags and souvenir box (from India) we found our driver to take us to the hotel.

The drive was pleasant and quick and we arrived at the hotel in under 30 minutes. Travellers are spoilt for choice in Hanoi, there are plenty of hotels/hostels in Hanoi’s Old Quarter, suiting all budgets. We decided to stay at the Tulinh Palace hotel 2, after reading great reviews on Booking.com and TripAdvisor.

We’re looking forward to see what Hanoi has to offer, _I’m so excited to get to try local Vietnamese food!_
