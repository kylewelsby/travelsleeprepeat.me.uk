So we’ve officially crossed the border and we are now in Cambodia, woo!

The journey so far has been pretty unpleasant; the only seats available on the bus to the border were at the back (where every bump, rattle and thump echoes through my bones). The woman in front of us has wretched her guts out the entire time (trust me, this is last thing you’d want to hear at 6am, whilst swaying side to side on a rickety old bus).

_Oh well_, we’re still optimistic and excited to get to Phnom Penh, only a few more hours to go!
