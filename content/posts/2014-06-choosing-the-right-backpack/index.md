The most crucial part of travelling is having the right equipment – but most importantly a decent backpack.

We initially checked a few backpacks online but realised that there’s no way of finding out if these backpacks are suitable for our frames – I’m only 5’3 whereas Kyle is 6’1. Plus, we didn’t want the hassle of ordering a backpack, waiting for delivery then finding out it wasn’t the right fit and then having the faff of sending it back!

**Top loading or front loading backpacks?**

With a top loading backpack all the contents have to be packed ‘vertically’. However this can prove to be a major disadvantage – if you want something at the bottom of you bag you’ll need unpack your pack to get what you need, then repack! _I don’t know about you but that’s just too long-winded for me!_

A front loading backpack is where you can unzip the panel in the same way like a suitcase. It is much easier to pack your contents and take a particular item out without minimal effort.

_Verdict?_ Front loading wins!

**Which size is best?**

We did some research into this and to be honest reviews were mixed. Some travelers swear by their 35L backpacks, whereas others were happy with their choice of a 65L backpack. Confused by size dimensions and brands we thought it’d be best to try the backpacks at the store.

I cannot recommend how useful is was to go to the store and trial out the backpacks. All the stores we went into put in a 10kg of weight inside to allow to us to get a real feel. We then walked around, going up and down stairs, sitting down and getting up. I first tried out the 65L backpacks but realised straight away that the bag was too big for me – so big even that I couldn’t even look up without hitting my head on the frame!

Eliminating the larger capacity we tried on the 55 litre backpacks instead. There was one particular brand – Osprey which had the best backpack in this size and was available in S/M and M/L size. Again we trialled the backpacks with the weight to test out. We were both surprised on how well the backpacks fitted. The interior of the packs had 2 large mesh zipped pockets and compression straps. There is also a back system zip which protects the straps and buckles – ideal for flights. The backpacks also have a detachable 15 litre daypack that can be clipped on your front for easy access to personal items – this was a bonus for me.

The search was over, we had found our travel backpacks!

**How much did it cost?**

We both felt that the Osprey Farpoint 55L backpack met the requirements we needed for our travels. The total price for 2 backpacks was £180.00

We were really pleased with the backpacks and felt the cost justified the quality of the product.

_Now for the fun part..deciding what goes inside!_
